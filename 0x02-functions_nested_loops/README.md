* Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

[1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/1-alphabet.c)
* Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

* Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

[3. islower](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/3-islower.c)
* Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

[4. isalpha](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/4-isalpha.c)

* Write a function that prints the sign of a number.

[6. There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/6-abs.c)
* Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer.

[7. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/7-print_last_digit.c)
* Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

[8. I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/8-24_hours.c)
* Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.

[9. Learn your times table](https://github.com/brian-1989/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/0x02-functions_nested_loops/9-times_table.c)
